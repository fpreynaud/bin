# bin #

This repository contains some scripts I like to have available from about anywhere

## rm ##
Instead of deleting files, this script puts them in a trash folder.
No need to cry anymore when you type something like:
`rm my/super/important/project/folder/* uselessfiles.txt` instead of
`rm my/super/important/project/folder/*uselessfiles.txt`

##Â parameter_handling.sh ##

A template for handling command-line arguments, in a more powerful way than what getopt(s) can allow.

## hexa ##

Return the hexadecimal representation of the text passed as input
